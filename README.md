> *Dotfiles, scripts, and experiments for my machines.*

Hey there! Friendly disclaimer, I tinker a lot. This repo is where I keep the personal configs, scripts, and tweaks that make my setups feel like mine.

These files are tailored to my hardware and workflow. Youâ€™ll find device-specific settings, one-off experiments, and other bits I want to keep in a single place. Theyâ€™re meant for reference and reuse by me, not guaranteed to work unchanged on other systems.

## Devices
- Lenovo Legion (Windows 11) - my primary device.
- Ubuntu Server - maintained to stay in an almost-replicable (I hope) server state.

Enjoy poking around ðŸ©µ
